    "Gridworld City, a thriving metropolis with a booming technology industry, has recently experienced an influx of grid-loving software engineers. Unfortunately, the city's street parking system, which charges a fixed rate, is struggling to keep up with the increased demand. To address this, the city council has decided to modify the pricing scheme to better promote social welfare. In general, the city considers social welfare higher when more parking is being used, the exception being that the city prefers that at least one spot is left unoccupied (so that it is available in case someone really needs it). The city council has created a Markov decision process (MDP) to model the demand for parking with a reward function that reflects its preferences. Now the city has hired you &mdash; an expert in dynamic programming &mdash; to help determine an optimal policy."

    "Observe that the value function qualitatively resembles the city council's preferences &mdash; it monotonically increases as more parking is used, until there is no parking left, in which case the value is lower. Because of the relatively simple reward function (more reward is accrued when many but not all parking spots are taken and less reward is accrued when few or all parking spots are taken) and the highly stochastic dynamics function (each state has positive probability of being reached each time step) the value functions of most policies will qualitatively resemble this graph. However, depending on the intelligence of the policy, the scale of the graph will differ. In other words, better policies will increase the expected return at every state rather than changing the relative desirability of the states. Intuitively, the value of a less desirable state can be increased by making it less likely to remain in a less desirable state. Similarly, the value of a more desirable state can be increased by making it more likely to remain in a more desirable state. That is to say, good policies are policies that spend more time in desirable states and less time in undesirable states. As we will see in this assignment, such a steady state distribution is achieved by setting the price to be low in low occupancy states (so that the occupancy will increase) and setting the price high when occupancy is high (so that full occupancy will be avoided)."
